Throughout my career as a systems developer, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects 
that have allowed me to grow professionally and contribute significantly to each organization. Below, 
I share some of the most remarkable experiences I have had so far.

### Centro de Convivência Municipal de Faxinal - CECOM (September 2023 - Present)
Currently, I am working at the Centro de Convivência Municipal de Faxinal, where I serve as a 
systems developer and English instructor for children in the community. This project allows me 
to combine my technical skills with my passion for teaching, helping to empower young talents 
and improve their future prospects. In addition to developing systems for the center, I am 
engaged in educational initiatives aimed at increasing digital inclusion and learning new 
technologies.

The CECOM is a social institution that provides services to the community, such as sports,
cultural activities, and educational programs. My role involves developing systems to manage
these services and activities. The main system I developed, called AfterSchool, is a platform for managing the
center's activities, including scheduling, registration, and attendance tracking.

My experience as a systems developer has allowed me to acquire skills that are rare in my country, such as fluency in English. Combining this ability with my passion for teaching, I completed English courses for teachers and became a certified instructor. Spending time with the children and teaching them English has been an incredibly rewarding experience.

### Freelance Work (July 2022 - Present)
Since July 2022, I have been working as a full-time freelance developer. During this period, 
I have utilized a variety of technologies such as NestJS, Docker, Next.js, React, and Supabase 
to create innovative and efficient solutions. The freedom to work independently has allowed me 
to explore new ideas and implement projects that meet my clients' specific needs. I have 
developed robust applications, carried out complex integrations, and automated processes that 
brought significant improvements to my clients' businesses.

### RollKall (April 2022 - July 2022)
As a front-end developer at RollKall, I had the opportunity to work with Docker to develop 
robust front-end applications. During the four months on this project, I also used React and 
Next.js to create intuitive user interfaces and optimize application performance. My contributions 
went beyond interface development, encompassing the resolution of critical bugs and the 
continuous improvement of user experience.

### Aktie Now (December 2020 - April 2022)
Working as a full stack developer at Aktie Now in São Caetano do Sul, I was responsible for 
developing and maintaining systems using AWS Lambda, NestJS, React, and other technologies. 
This project was crucial for my development as a full stack developer, allowing me to gain a 
deep understanding of scalable and efficient system architectures. During my time at Aktie Now, 
I developed various integration middlewares, fetching information from legacy databases and 
passing it to SAP. Additionally, I created numerous Zendesk apps for clients, including major 
names like Magazine Luiza. I also implemented performance improvements in existing systems 
and developed new functionalities that increased operational efficiency.

### Freelance Work (April 2018 - April 2020)
As a freelance developer, I managed my own company and worked on various projects using AWS 
Lambda, NestJS, React, Node.js, and other skills. During this period, I developed the official 
websites for the municipalities of Cruzmaltina, Faxinal, and Mauá da Serra, the website for 
the Public Servants Union of Faxinal, and the website for the chamber of Mauá da Serra, all 
in Paraná. I also created websites for the private security company STOP Segurança and the 
French cleaning company RDO Nettoyage. All these websites were built from scratch, initially 
with React and Node.js, and later with Next.js, maintaining the philosophy of creating 
customized solutions for each client. Additionally, I developed automation scripts and internal 
tools that helped my clients optimize their business processes.

### Prefeitura Municipal de Cruzmaltina (June 2016 - December 2018)
The beginning of my career was marked by an internship at the Prefeitura Municipal de Cruzmaltina, 
where I worked part-time in development and IT. During the two years and seven months in this role, 
I gained a solid foundation in systems development and a practical understanding of IT operations 
in a public organization. I participated in several projects aimed at modernizing internal systems, 
helping to digitize processes and implement new technologies that improved administrative efficiency.

### Other Notable Projects
In addition to formal experiences, I have conducted AI tests, creating a series of web scraping 
scripts to fetch news from various sources and rewrite them. Although this project is private on 
my GitHub for security reasons, it demonstrates my ability to work with advanced and innovative 
technologies. I have also developed middlewares and complex integrations in various other projects, 
showcasing my capability to solve challenging technical problems and deliver high-quality solutions.

Each of these experiences has contributed to shaping my career and preparing me for future 
challenges. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, always seeking new 
opportunities to innovate and make a difference.
