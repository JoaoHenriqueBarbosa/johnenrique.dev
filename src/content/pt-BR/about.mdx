# About Me

## João Henrique Barbosa - Full-Stack Developer

Hello! I'm João Henrique Barbosa, a full-stack developer with a deep passion for technology and creating exceptional digital experiences. Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in transforming ideas into practical and efficient solutions, always paying close attention to detail and maintaining a commitment to quality.

### My Work Philosophy

I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and improve the world around us. Every line of code I write is an opportunity to contribute to this transformation, whether by creating an application that makes people's lives easier or developing systems that optimize processes and drive business growth. My approach is always user-centered, aiming to deliver products that are not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.

### Skills and Technologies

My journey as a developer has allowed me to work with a wide range of technologies. I have solid experience with frameworks like React, Next.js, and NestJS, and I'm proficient with Docker, Supabase, and AWS. I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and tools, always looking to learn and improve my skills.

### Projects That Inspire Me

Over the years, I've had the chance to participate in incredible projects that challenged me and allowed me to grow professionally. From developing school management systems to AI-powered personal assistants, each project has been an opportunity to apply my knowledge and see the positive impact technology can have.

### Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time on hobbies that help me stay creative and sharp. I'm a fan of drawing with colored pencils, especially scenes from my favorite movies and TV shows like Doctor Who and Star Trek. Additionally, I practice the Gospel at Home every Thursday night, which provides me with a moment of reflection and peace.

### Let's Talk

I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you have an idea, a project, or just want to chat about technology, feel free to get in touch. It will be a pleasure to talk with you!
